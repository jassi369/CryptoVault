CryptoVault

CryptoVault is a web app that allows users to encrypt text files using the AES encryption algorithm. The app is built with JavaScript and utilizes the CryptoJS library for encryption and decryption.

Users can select a text file from their device using a file input field, and then encrypt the file by clicking a button. The encrypted file is then available for download. The app does not store any files on the server, so user data is kept secure.

CryptoVault is a simple and easy-to-use tool for protecting sensitive text files from prying eyes. Whether you need to send confidential information via email or store it in the cloud, CryptoVault provides a quick and reliable way to keep your data safe.
