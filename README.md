# CryptoVault

CryptoVault is a web app that allows users to encrypt text files using the AES encryption algorithm. The app is built with JavaScript and utilizes the CryptoJS library for encryption and decryption.

## Features

- AES encryption for secure file protection
- Easy-to-use interface for file selection and encryption
- No server-side storage for enhanced security
- Quick and reliable file encryption and decryption

## Getting Started

To use CryptoVault, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. The app requires an internet connection to load the CryptoJS library from a CDN, but otherwise runs entirely client-side.

## Usage

1. Open CryptoVault in your browser
2. Select a text file to encrypt using the file input field
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the selected file
4. Download the encrypted file by clicking the "Download" button

Note: The app does not store any files on the server, so user data is kept secure.
